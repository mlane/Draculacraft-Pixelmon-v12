# Draculacraft Pixelmon v12 (not ready)

Projected launch: 07/01/2022

Will feature 50+ quests with incentives for progressing in Pixelmon with some basic automation (actually additions, chickens, translocators)

Each season you will be presented with a curated list of starter pokemon to make the more interesting (e.g. Dratini, Eevee, Riolu).

This season objectives will be as follows
- Completing the questline
- Gotta Catch 'Em All (catch at least 150 (~17% of 898) unique Pokemon)
- Beating each member of the "Elite Four"???
- Beating Draculacraft's seasonal team
